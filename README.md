# go-redis-pmem

## Warning
VMware has ended active development of this project, this repository will no longer be updated.

## Overview
This is a Go implementation of Redis designed for persistent memory. Only a
limited subset of Redis commands are currently supported.

## Try it out

### Prerequisites

To use this package, you need new extensions to the Go language. These changes
are maintained in a separate repository [here](https://github.com/jerrinsg/go-pmem).

### Build & Run

1. Download and build Go compiler designed for persistent memory. Follow
instructions [here](https://github.com/jerrinsg/go-pmem).

2. ```go get -v -u github.com/vmware-samples/go-redis-pmem/...```
Make sure to use the Go binary built in step 1.

3. To build and run the example application
```
$ cd example
$ go build app.go
$ ./app
```
Make sure to use the Go binary built in step 1.

## Documentation

This is a Go version of Redis designed for persistent memory. It uses the
functionalities provided by the [go-pmem-transaction](https://github.com/vmware/go-pmem-transaction)
library in its implementation.
This implementation of Redis only supports a limited set of Redis commands.
Please refer to `redis/server.go` for the list of supported commands.
It is put out as an implementation example of the [go-pmem-transaction](https://github.com/vmware/go-pmem-transaction)
library.

By default the database file is created at the same path from which the application
is run. This location can be changed by modifying the `DATABASE` string in
`redis/server.go`. If the database file is not created in a persistent memory
device, then application performance will be really slow. If a persistent memory
device is not available, then it can be emulated using DRAM. See documentation
[here](https://pmem.io/2016/02/22/pm-emulation.html).
